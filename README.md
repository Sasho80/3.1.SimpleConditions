01.Example: ExcellentResult
We read the grade from the console and check if it's excellent (â‰¥ 5.50).
double grade;
cin>>grade;
if (grade>=5.50){
cout<<"Excellent!"<<endl;
}
Test the code from the example locally. Try entering different grades, for example 4.75, 5.49, 5.50
and 6.00. For grades less than 5.50, the program will not give any output, however if the grade is
5.50 or greater, the output would be "Excellent!".

02.Example: Excellent Grade or Not
Like the example above, we read the grade from the console and check if it's excellent, but this time 
we should output the result in both cases.
double grade;
cin>>grade;
if (grade>=5.50){
cout<<"Exelent!"<<endl;
}
else{
cout<<"Not excellent!"<<endl;
}
